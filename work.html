  <h2>Conceptual Understanding</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>The goal of this web design project is to use HTML, CSS, and the Bootstrap framework to create a professional, responsive multi-page résumé website. The objective is to exhibit both technical skills and graphic design knowledge in effectively presenting a personal brand in an online setting. Responsive design is a crucial component in this task. The layout must smoothly adjust to numerous screen sizes because customers visit websites on a variety of devices. The website will remain functional and aesthetically pleasing across PCs, tablets and mobile devices with the use of CSS media queries and Bootstrap's grid framework. In addition to enhancing user experience, this flexibility shows an awareness of present web design standards. After completing my design on my laptop, I checked the layout of my website on my phone, iPad and my mother's Android phone. The website's layout worked on all devices, therefore I was successful. The website's textual and visual design are equally significant. In order to improve easy reading, the layout has to maintain a balance between creativity and quality while utilising alignment, whitespace and consistent formatting. To make it easier for viewers to navigate content, design should adhere to a clear structure that distinguishes headings, subheadings and body text. In addition to supporting accessibility and aesthetic appeal, effective use of colour, contrast and composition ensures that the website is both interesting and simple to read. The target audience and the writer's personality should be reflected in the website's branding and imagery. Quality and attention to detail are communicated through an organised colour palette, suitable fonts and organised photographs. High quality, appropriately scaled and quickly loading images are essential. The user's feeling of navigation and brand identity are boosted when all three pages, Home, About Me and Work Experience, are similar. Additionally, creating content is essential. Every section needs to be clear, well written and appropriate for the target audience. While the About Me section highlights abilities and goals, the main page should provide a brief professional introduction. The achievements, goals and qualifications should be clearly visible on the Work Experience and Education page. Easy access for future employers is ensured by a printable PDF resume and a Contact section with easily accessible links. Usability testing is another vital part. Finding any problems with the website's functioning or design is helped by testing it with a minimum of three people and using browsers like Chrome and Firefox. In conclusion, this project creates an online CV that is responsive, aesthetically pleasing and customer focused by combining design theory with technical experience. It demonstrates the technical skills, design knowledge and professional presentation skills necessary for success in the field of digital design.</li>
