  <h1>About me</h1>
  <p>I was born in Iraq and currently live in Australia, where I have a strong interest in combining technology and art. I was a professional photographer with a focus on vehicle photography from 2019 until 2023. I concentrated on taking stunning vehicle photos during this time that emphasised performance, design, and detail. I worked with vehicle supporters, companies, and marketing teams to create visually appealing material through photo editing, colour correction, and digital advertising on social media platforms. My sense of design, lighting, and visual storytelling, as well as my knowledge of how visual media can attract clients while creating a company's reputation, were all enhanced by this experience. Currently, I am studying a Diploma in Information and Communication Technology (ICT), where I am developing front end web design and development skills. I'm currently learning front end web design and development abilities while pursuing a diploma in information and communication technology (ICT). I'm especially interested in turning my creative ideas into digital media and building websites that are both aesthetically pleasing and fast. My objective is to create visually appealing and useful internet images, websites and product demonstrations. My goal is to assist clients in presenting their work and products in a modern and professional manner by combining my technical web design talents with my background knowledge in photography.</p>
